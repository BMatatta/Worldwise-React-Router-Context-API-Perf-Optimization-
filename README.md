# React + Vite

Using the power of React, it's libraries and following the React course of Jonas Schmedtmann, the WorldWise application has been created.

This demo project was usefull to me as a learning tool for building a SPA (Single-Page Application) using React Router, managing a greater number of global UI state using Context API and Reacts useReducer hook, and optimizing the application through usage of useMemo and useCallback hooks.

The application was created with Vite using the React framework template.

# About the App

WorldWise is an app that lets you pin any location on the world map and share your thoughts or travel experience on visited locations. By logging into your account (currently demo account) you can add, edit and delete all your notes across the globe!

# How to Use

1. Download ZIP file and unpack in the designated folder
2. Open the project folder in your IDE and run "npm i" to install dependencies
3. Run the "npm run server" command to open up the connection to the .json file
4. Since this is a Vite-powered app, start the app using the "npm run dev" command
